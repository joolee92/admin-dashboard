                <p>
                  This is a calculator made to calculate numbers. It includes
                  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, deviation,
                  transposition, and transmutation. Other calculators work similarly
                  but this calculator works for this calculator.

                  Use this music player to listen to your favorite lossless files or
                  MP3 files. Whether you like jazz, rock, blues, or country/western
                  it can all be listened to through this seamless application. There
                  is no bloat and no promotion of artists. Only what you have
                  downloaded on your system. It will only play what you tell it to
                  like a record player or phonograph.

                <p>
                  Block all of those pesky ads that bother you while you're hard at
                  work! Until your work is done in which case you can turn it off
                  because a little exposure to marketing is good every now and then.
                  It keeps you in touch with the present. Or, you can opt to keep it
                  on at all times. Of course, assuming you're scrupulous enough to
                  donate to those websites which you use often.

                <p>
                  When you need a break from life and you're too lazy to go to the
                  gym or find a piece of media to watch, you can simply click on
                  this cookie and it a counter will go up for each time you click
                  the cookie. The cookie does not crumble, it does not break, it
                  doesn't even budge when you click it. It is a static image. You
                  should seriously reconsider what you do with your time, but if you
                  insist, then you can find even the most minute feeling of
                  accomplishment seeing that you've clicked this cookie... say, 100
                  times. Good job.

                <p>
                  The realest spreadsheet out there. For the player whose hustler
                  mentality simply isn't satisfied by the boring, menial drab of
                  regular office spreadsheet programs. Plan out your finances in
                  style! View your statistics and adjust them with the smoothness of
                  cognac. Just don't show your boss that you're using this.

                <p>
                  If you can't afford health insurance, this is your next best
                  option. Put down all of your symptoms and 'Robot MD' will tell you
                  the meaning of all of your ailments! 90% of the time, however, it
                  will tell you to drink more fluids. The other 10% of the time it
                  will diagnose you with a terminal illness. Better than having to
                  pay the government, though... or some nerd doctor.
